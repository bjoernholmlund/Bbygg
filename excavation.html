            <h2>Excavation</h2><br>
            <p>Holmlund Contracting provides complete contracting services for excavation and planning for all types of projects. 
              We operate throughout Sweden and have the capacity to handle large-scale jobs.

              To establish a solid foundation, every construction requires a firm and stable base. We specialize in rough excavation 
              for larger projects, which includes the removal of substantial quantities of excavated materials. We have the capability 
              to manage the transportation of large volumes of excavated material with our own dump sites.
              
              We perform excavation work across the entire country. A project is only as good as its foundational work—feel free to 
              reach out for more information about our services.</p>
                
                <h2>Excavation – Cost or Investment</h2>
                <p>Excavation is the foundation and a prerequisite for ensuring the success of any construction project. 
                  Without proper excavation, thorough preliminary investigations, and knowledgeable professionals, the end result may fall short. 
                  Avoid issues with settlement and stability! Contact Holmlund Contracting, a trusted name in the industry.</p>

            <h2>Extent of excavation</h2>

            <p>The extent of excavation required depends on the necessary depth, influenced by soil conditions and the risk of frost. 
              Cold climates, large constructions, and significant amounts of topsoil necessitate a deeper foundation. We efficiently 
              manage the fill material and transport it away as needed. Additionally, we have the resources to deliver gravel for various 
              types of foundations and reinforcement layers. We undertake all types of excavation and drainage work, specializing in larger projects.</p>

               <h2>We take environmental work seriously</h2>

               <p>At Holmlund Contracting, we take our environmental responsibilities seriously. We handle materials carefully, 
                ensuring proper disposal and recycling. We are certified according to ISO 14001, which mandates continuous improvement 
                in our environmental practices. Our fleet includes one of Sweden's most modern and resource-efficient machinery, 
                which helps us reduce fuel consumption and minimize carbon emissions during our work. These advanced machines meet the 
                toughest environmental classifications and requirements.</p>
