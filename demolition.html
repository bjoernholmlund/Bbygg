              <p>
                The price of demolishing a house depends entirely on the scope of the work. The size of the house, 
                availability and time for execution are some of the parameters that affect the price. It is impossible 
                o say a price for house demolition before we have examined these parameters.</p>

            <summary>When is a demolition permit required?</summary>
             <p>A demolition permit is needed to demolish entire buildings or parts of buildings:

              - within a detailed planned area, unless the municipality has reduced the permit obligation through a planning provision - outside an area with a detailed plan,
               if the municipality has decided that a demolition permit is required through area regulations</p>
           </details>
           
           <details>
            <summary>How long does a demolition permit last?</summary>
             <p>A demolition permit ceases to apply if the demolition work is not started within two years or completed within
               five years after the demolition permit was issued.</p>
           </details>
           
           <details>
            <summary>How much does a demolition permit cost?</summary>
             <p>Within a detailed planned area, you usually need a demolition permit to demolish buildings or parts of buildings.
               For areas with zoning regulations, the municipality can decide that a demolition permit is required. Outside of 
               areas with a detailed plan or area regulations, a demolition permit is never required.

              The building board charges fees for decisions on start notices and final notices. This also applies to technical consultations, 
              final consultations, workplace visits and other supervisory visits to the construction site. Contact the building board in your 
              municipality if you want to know how high the fee is.</p>
