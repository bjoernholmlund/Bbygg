             <h2>Milling – Effective Solutions</h2>
             <p>We carry out all types of milling—steel, concrete, stone, asphalt, metal, and frost—using efficient and modern methods. 
              With the right expertise and one of the most up-to-date machinery fleets in the country, we ensure the job gets done! 
              We frequently use both milling and disc milling techniques. Milling allows for precise controlled demolition and cutting of concrete 
              (including reinforced concrete), cable trenches, pipe trenches, limestone, and hard frost, where demolition cuts do not need to be perfect.

              We perform planar milling of concrete, asphalt, as well as milling of steel and other metals using a cutting disc that operates 
              similarly to an angle grinder. The rotating cutting disc slices through the material, allowing for demolition in sections. 
              Hydraulic disc mills are much more efficient than hydraulic hammers, concrete saws, wire saws, and concrete shears. 
              The disc mill quickly cuts through concrete, freeing up concrete blocks that can be removed and crushed, thereby quickly clearing the worksite for other tasks.
              
              This also enables selective demolition, allowing for the removal of only those parts of the structure that are damaged 
              or need replacing. Previously, wire and concrete sawing were the dominant methods for such work; however, disc mills 
              provide a safer and more efficient alternative for operators. We have achieved remarkable results with disc milling, 
              such as facilitating pedestrian and bicycle traffic through containers while we cut and removed roadway sections with our excavators.</p>

            <h2>Concrete Milling – Efficient and Resource-Saving</h2>
            <p>The scope of excavation required depends on the necessary depth, which is influenced by the condition of the ground and the risk of frost heave. 
              Colder climates, large structures, and significant layers of topsoil mean that the foundation depth needs to be greater. We manage and remove the 
              fill material and have the resources to transport gravel for various types of foundations and reinforcement layers. We handle all types of 
              excavation and drainage work, from small to large-scale projects, but specialize in major operations.</p>
               
               <h2>Milling Steel and Metal – Hydraulic Milling with Cutting Disc</h2>
               <p>At Holmlund Contracting, we prioritize environmental sustainability. The materials we remove are handled responsibly, 
                ensuring minimal environmental impact. We adhere to stringent environmental standards, certified under ISO 14001, 
                which requires us to continually improve our environmental practices. We also operate one of Sweden's most modern fleets of machines, 
                designed to be fuel-efficient and to reduce carbon emissions. Our advanced equipment allows us to meet the highest environmental classifications and requirements.</p>
